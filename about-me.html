      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Year Up is a year long program that lets young adults connect with Fortune 500 jobs.
      Before Year Up, I was working at Taco Time in West Seattle. I interned at Amazon for six
      months and got hired on an awesome team. However, good things don't last forever, my
      team got reorged and we went under new management multiple times. I'm still learning a lot.
      Hopefully this class will open even more opportunities for my at Amazon and beyond!
